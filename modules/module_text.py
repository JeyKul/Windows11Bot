**How to Install Blokada**

By default, Android will block the installation of non-Play store APKs. They do this to prevent any malicious apps from being installed under your nose. So first we will tell Android to allow apps from unknown sources. To do this, go to Settings > Security > Unknown sources.
Next, you’ll want to download the latest APK from [here](https://blokada.org/#download) and install it like normal.
Now you should have successfully installed Blokada from the APK on their website.

**How to Activate Ad-Block**

When you launch Blokada for the first time, you’ll be greeted with the main screen that shows a power button icon. When you tap it, you’ll activate the ad-block service.
A notification will pop up asking about starting a VPN connection. Select “ok” and the ad-block service will begin.
At the bottom of the home screen, you’ll be able to keep track of how many ads have been blocked successfully. You’ll be surprised at how many background connections your device makes on just about any website.
